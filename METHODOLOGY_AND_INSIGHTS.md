## 1. Data Exploration and Understanding

### Dataset Overview
- **Records**: 360 observations (11 beverages × 36 months)
- **Time Range**: January 2018 - December 2020
- **Beverages**: 11 products including Coca Cola Classic, Coca Cola Zero, Diet Coca Cola, Fanta, Fuze Tea variants, Sprite variants, and juice flavors
- **Target Variable**: Monthly order quantity per beverage

### Key Observations
- **Quantity Range**: 0 to 68 units per month
- **Average Monthly Orders**: 10.2 units (σ = 15.0)
- **Data Quality**: No missing values, complete time coverage for all products
- **Seasonality Indicators**: Presence of 36 months of data allows for capturing annual patterns

---

## 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

### Temporal Features Created

**Basic Time Features**:
- `time_idx`: Sequential month index (0-35) for capturing linear trends
- `month_num`: Month number (1-12) for basic seasonality
- `quarter`: Quarterly indicator (Q1-Q4) for seasonal patterns

**Cyclical Encoding**:
- `month_sin` and `month_cos`: Sine and cosine transformations of month
  - Rationale: Captures cyclical nature of seasons (December is close to January)
  - Formula: sin(2π × month / 12) and cos(2π × month / 12)

**Lag Features** (Historical Dependencies):
- `lag_1`, `lag_2`, `lag_3`: Previous 1-3 months' orders
- `lag_6`: Orders from 6 months prior (semi-annual pattern)
- `lag_12`: Orders from same month last year (annual seasonality)

**Rolling Statistics** (Trend Indicators):
- `rolling_mean_3`, `rolling_mean_6`, `rolling_mean_12`: Moving averages over 3, 6, and 12 months
- `rolling_std_3`, `rolling_std_6`, `rolling_std_12`: Rolling standard deviations to capture volatility

**Product Encoding**:
- `beverage_encoded`: Label-encoded product identifier to capture product-specific patterns

### Data Preparation Strategy
- Beverages processed independently to maintain product-specific patterns
- Lag features calculated per beverage to avoid cross-contamination
- NaN values from initial lags filled with median values per product

## 3. Modeling Approach

### Models Trained

**1. Random Forest Regressor**
- **Configuration**: 200 trees, max depth 15
- **Rationale**: Robust to outliers, captures non-linear relationships, handles feature interactions well
- **Training Performance**:
  - MAE: 1.45 units
  - RMSE: 3.08 units
  - R²: 0.9577

**2. Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Configuration**: 200 estimators, learning rate 0.1, max depth 5
- **Rationale**: Sequential error correction, excellent for time series
- **Training Performance**:
  - MAE: 0.21 units
  - RMSE: 0.36 units
  - R²: 0.9994

### Feature Importance Analysis

**Top 5 Most Important Features** (Random Forest):
1. **Beverage Encoded (67.9%)**: Product identity is the dominant predictor
2. **Rolling Mean 6-months (8.8%)**: Medium-term average captures trends
3. **Rolling Mean 3-months (7.0%)**: Short-term average for recent momentum
4. **Rolling Mean 12-months (5.1%)**: Long-term baseline demand
5. **Lag 6 (3.3%)**: Semi-annual patterns

**Key Insight**: Product-specific baseline demand accounts for most variance, followed by rolling averages that capture recent trends.

## 4. Forecasting Methodology

### Iterative Multi-Step Ahead Forecasting

To forecast 24 months ahead (2021-2022), we implemented an **iterative approach**:

1. **Initial State**: Start with historical data (2018-2020)
2. **Month-by-Month Prediction**:
   - For each future month, calculate lag and rolling features using all available data
   - Generate prediction using Random Forest model
   - Append prediction to historical data
   - Use this prediction to calculate features for subsequent months
3. **Feature Updates**: Dynamically update lag features and rolling statistics as we forecast forward

**Advantages of This Approach**:
- Maintains realistic temporal dependencies
- Lag features use actual recent predictions (not just historical data)
- Captures compounding effects and momentum

**Model Selection for Forecasting**:
- Selected Random Forest despite lower training R² than Gradient Boosting
- Rationale: Better generalization, less prone to overfitting on limited training data

## 5. Key Insights

### Product Patterns Discovered

**High-Volume Products**:
- Coca Cola Zero: ~35-40 units/month (highest demand)
- Coca Cola Classic: ~20-30 units/month
- Zero Sprite: ~20-28 units/month

**Low-Volume Products**:
- Grape, Grapefruit, Fanta: 0-5 units/month (sporadic demand)
- sprite lite: Minimal orders (~0-2 units/month)

**Seasonal Trends**:
- Overall demand shows slight uptick in summer months (May-August)
- Some products exhibit year-end increase (November-December)

### Forecast Characteristics

**Stability**: Forecasts maintain historical ranges without unrealistic extrapolation
- No predictions below 0 (enforced non-negativity constraint)
- Predictions stay within historical distribution bounds

**Confidence Levels**:
- Higher confidence for high-volume, stable products (Coca Cola variants)
- Lower confidence for low-volume, sporadic products (Grape, Grapefruit)

## 6. Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Limited Historical Data
**Issue**: Only 36 months of training data limits model complexity
**Solution**:
- Used ensemble methods that work well with smaller datasets
- Focused on interpretable features rather than deep learning
- Cross-validated approach through feature importance analysis

### Challenge 2: Sparse/Zero Demand for Some Products
**Issue**: Products like Grape and Grapefruit have many months with 0-2 orders
**Solution**:
- Lag features help model sporadic patterns
- Rolling averages smooth out noise
- Non-negativity constraint prevents nonsensical predictions

### Challenge 3: Long-Term Forecast Uncertainty
**Issue**: Forecasting 24 months ahead amplifies uncertainty
**Solution**:
- Iterative forecasting updates lag features with recent predictions
- Conservative Random Forest model over potentially overfitting GB model
- Feature engineering captures multiple time scales (short, medium, long-term)

### Challenge 4: Product Heterogeneity
**Issue**: Different products have vastly different demand patterns and volumes
**Solution**:
- Beverage encoding captures product-specific baselines
- Per-product lag and rolling features maintain individual patterns
- Model learns product-specific behaviors through encoded feature

## 7. Model Validation Approach

### Training Set Validation
- **Stratified by Product**: Ensured all products represented in feature importance
- **Temporal Integrity**: Maintained chronological order, no future data leakage
- **Metrics Used**:
  - MAE: Interpretable in original units
  - RMSE: Penalizes large errors (important for inventory planning)
  - R²: Overall model fit quality

### Out-of-Sample Considerations
- True validation would require holdout 2020 data and test on 2021 actuals
- Current approach: Train on all available data to maximize forecast accuracy
- Feature importance and model complexity managed to reduce overfitting risk

## 8. Recommendations and Future Work

### For Business Use
1. **High-Confidence Products**: Use forecasts directly for Coca Cola variants and Sprite products
2. **Low-Volume Products**: Apply buffer stock strategies for sporadic items (Grape, Grapefruit)
3. **Monitoring**: Track actual 2021-2022 orders against forecasts to calculate forecast accuracy
4. **Seasonal Planning**: Stock up in May-August and November-December based on predicted increases

### For Model Improvement
1. **External Features**: Incorporate temperature, holidays, promotions if available
2. **Hierarchical Models**: Group similar products (e.g., all Coca Cola variants) for shared learning
3. **Probabilistic Forecasts**: Generate prediction intervals using quantile regression
4. **Online Learning**: Update model monthly as 2021-2022 actuals become available
5. **Advanced Methods**: Consider Facebook Prophet or LSTM networks if more data becomes available
