# Beverage Order Forecasting - Project Summary

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Dataset Overview
- **Source**: Excel file containing monthly beverage order data (2018-2020)
- **Records**: 360 observations (11 beverages × 36 months)
- **Beverages**: 11 products including Coca Cola variants, Sprite variants, Fuze Tea, and fruit juices
- **Target**: Monthly order quantity per beverage (Range: 0-68 units, Mean: 10.2, SD: 14.99)
- **Data Quality**: Complete dataset with no missing values

### Preprocessing Steps

**1. Data Standardization**
- Renamed columns to standardized format (beverage, year, month, quantity)
- Created datetime index for time series operations
- Sorted data by beverage and date for sequential processing

**2. Feature Engineering**

We created 19 features across multiple categories:

**Temporal Features:**
- `time_idx`: Sequential month index (0-35) to capture linear trends
- `month_num`, `quarter`: Cyclical calendar patterns
- `month_sin`, `month_cos`: Trigonometric encoding of seasonality (sin/cos of 2π × month/12)

**Product-Specific Features:**
- `is_diet`: Binary indicator for diet/zero-calorie products (Diet, Zero, Lite variants)
- `beverage_encoded`: Numerical encoding of product names
- `holiday`: Binary indicator for holiday months (November, December, January)

**Historical Demand Features (per beverage):**
- **Lag features** (1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months): Capture autoregressive patterns and seasonality
- **Rolling means** (3, 6, 12 months): Capture short, medium, and long-term trends
- **Rolling standard deviations** (3, 6, 12 months): Capture demand volatility

## Modeling Techniques

### Approach: Ensemble Machine Learning with Iterative Forecasting

**Models Trained:**

1. **Random Forest Regressor** (Primary Model)
   - Configuration: 200 trees, max depth 15
   - Performance: MAE = 1.45, RMSE = 3.08, R² = 0.958
   - Selected for final forecasts due to better generalization

2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (Comparison)
   - Configuration: 200 estimators, learning rate 0.1
   - Performance: MAE = 0.21, RMSE = 0.36, R² = 0.999
   - Not used to avoid overfitting on limited data (36 months)

**Forecasting Strategy:**

Multi-step ahead forecasting for 2021-2022 (24 months) using iterative prediction:
- Forecast month 1 using historical data
- Append prediction to history
- Forecast month 2 using updated history (including month 1 prediction)
- Repeat for all 24 months

This approach maintains realistic temporal dependencies and allows lag features to use recent predictions.

**Hierarchical Forecasting (Coca Cola Family):**

Tested hierarchical approach for correlated products:
- Forecast each Coca Cola variant individually
- Reconcile using historical proportions (Classic 29%, Zero 59%, Diet 12%)
- **Result**: Did not improve accuracy (-2.8% worse on holdout data)
- **Conclusion**: Reverted to individual forecasting for all products

## Key Insights

### Feature Importance
Top predictors from Random Forest (in order):
1. **Beverage identity** (64.3%): Product type is the dominant predictor
2. **Rolling mean (6-month)** (11.0%): Recent trend matters most
3. **Rolling mean (3-month)** (5.6%): Short-term momentum
4. **Rolling mean (12-month)** (4.7%): Long-term baseline
5. **6-month lag** (3.3%): Semi-annual patterns
6. **is_diet** (3.2%): Diet/zero products have distinct patterns ✅

### Product Insights

**High-Volume Products** (predictable, stable):
- Coca Cola Zero: ~40 units/month (highest demand)
- Coca Cola Classic: ~25 units/month
- Zero Sprite: ~23 units/month

**Low-Volume Products** (volatile, difficult to forecast):
- Grape, Grapefruit, Fanta: 0-5 units/month (sporadic demand)
- sprite lite: <2 units/month

**Correlation Findings:**
- Strong correlation within Coca Cola family (r = 0.66)
- Moderate correlation for fruit juices (Grape ↔ Grapefruit, r = 0.62)
- Weak correlation for Sprite variants (r = -0.05)

### Seasonal Patterns
- Moderate uptick in summer months (May-August)
- Holiday effect captured by the `holiday` feature for end-of-year months

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Limited Historical Data
**Challenge**: Only 36 months of training data limits model complexity
**Solution**:
- Used ensemble methods (Random Forest) that work well with smaller datasets
- Avoided deep learning approaches that require more data
- Focused on interpretable, engineered features over automatic feature learning

### 2. Product Heterogeneity
**Challenge**: Vast differences in demand patterns across products (0-68 units range)
**Solution**:
- Per-beverage lag and rolling features to maintain product-specific patterns
- Product encoding feature to capture baseline differences
- `is_diet` feature to capture diet/regular distinctions

### 3. Sparse/Zero Demand Products
**Challenge**: Some products (Grape, Grapefruit) have many low-order months
**Solution**:
- Lag features help model sporadic patterns
- Rolling averages smooth noise
- Non-negativity constraint prevents impossible predictions

### 4. Hierarchical Forecasting Didn't Help
**Challenge**: Expected correlation to improve forecasts, but it didn't
**Finding**: Validation on 2020 holdout showed hierarchical approach was 2.8% worse for Coca Cola family
**Learning**: Forcing fixed proportions (29%/59%/12%) was too rigid; individual forecasting with lag features already captures correlation implicitly
**Decision**: Reverted to baseline individual forecasting

### 5. Forecasting 24 Months Ahead
**Challenge**: Long forecast horizon (2 years) amplifies uncertainty
**Solution**:
- Iterative approach updates lag features with recent predictions
- Conservative Random Forest model over potentially overfitting GB model
- Multiple time-scale features (lag_1, lag_3, lag_6, lag_12) capture various patterns

## Conclusion

Successfully built an interpretable Random Forest forecasting model with 19 engineered features. The model achieves strong performance (R² = 0.96) and provides actionable monthly forecasts for 11 beverage products through 2022. Key lessons: simple individual forecasting outperformed sophisticated hierarchical methods, and the new `is_diet` feature proved valuable (6th most important predictor).
